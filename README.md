# julia-sets
A python program that creates a visualisation of a Julia set or Mandelbrot set. This was part of homework during my undergraduate maths degree. Created some nice images with it. Input function has to be manually changed, perhaps one day I'll come back to it and add a user input option and tidy things up.
